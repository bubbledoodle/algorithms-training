This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

ez. like change two element, this time the change is made at TreeNode level.
the first thing to do, like every tree problems, is to check if null

and recursion.
